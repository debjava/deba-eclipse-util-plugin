Download
To test the application you have to download two jar files and place the two jar files in dropins directory of your eclipse installation directory and restart Eclipse IDE. The best practice will be to start the eclipse with -clean option after installing any plugin. Go to eclipse installation directory in the command prompt and type the command eclipse -clean. This is one time activity.

Eclipse Util Plugin
Go to External links and click on Download Util Plugin link to download the jar file having name deba.eclipse.util_1.0.0.201307051837.jar. Place the jar file in the directory dropins directory of your Eclipse installation directory. This is the main utility plugin.

Eclipse Screenshot Util Plugin for (Ganymede,Galileo,Helios,Indigo)
If your using Ganymede,Galileo,Helios or Indigo version of Eclipse, Go to External links and click on Download ScreenShot Plugin for Ganymede-Indigo link to download the jar file having name screenshotutil_1.0.0.201307051857.jar. Place the jar file in the directory dropins directory of your Eclipse installation directory. This is the utility plugin for taking screenshot from the eclipse editor and to split the Eclipse Text Editor.

Eclipse Screenshot Util Plugin for (Eclipse Kepler)
If your using Eclipse Kepler (Latest), Go to External links and click on Download Screenshot Plugin for Kepler link to download the jar file having name screenshotutilkepler_1.0.0.201307051859.jar.

Conclusion
I have developed this plugin to minimize the development activities to some extent not to a larger extent. This Eclipse plugin can be considered as a tutorial towards Eclipse Plugin Development. You can look into source code hosted in this site. I am very much thankful to my parents and my wife for their cooperation for my RnD.
