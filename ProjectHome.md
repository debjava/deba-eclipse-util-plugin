# Download #
To test the application you have to download two jar files and place the two jar files in **dropins** directory of your eclipse installation directory and restart Eclipse IDE. The best practice will be to start the eclipse with **-clean** option after installing any plugin. Go to eclipse installation directory in the command prompt and type the command **eclipse -clean**. This is one time activity.

# Conclusion #
I have developed this plugin to minimize the development activities to some extent not to a larger extent. This Eclipse plugin can be considered as a tutorial towards Eclipse Plugin Development. You can look into source code hosted in this site. I am very much thankful to my parents and my wife for their cooperation for my RnD.
